<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About the Project

<img src="demo/demo1.png" alt="Application Look">

CharaPlanner aims to provide an efficient way to create, edit and store original character (OC) sheets for writers, artists, roleplayers, etc. <br>
You can create and save databases to store multiple characters : each database will come as a .xml format file to save anywhere on your computer.
CharaPlanner only reads its own XML formatted files.
<br>
<br>
This application is a personal educational project created to help me learn Java and JavaFX.<br>
It is not intended for commercial use and may undergo further development in the future.

## Contributing

Any contributions are greatly appreciated as I'm still learning JavaFX development and my code is far from perfect.
